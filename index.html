  // Long Polish joke rewritten in English storytelling style:
  `John Smith is walking past his neighbour’s house one afternoon when he notices something unbelievable.
Right there on the neighbour’s lawn is a full tennis court. And playing on it are Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal.

Stunned, John asks:
"Mate, why do you have a tennis court and two of the greatest players alive in your garden?"

The neighbour replies:
"I found Aladdin’s lamp. Rubbed it, genie came out, I made a wish — and here we are."

John is thrilled. "Can I try?"
"Of course," says the neighbour, "but the genie is a bit hard of hearing."

John takes the lamp home, rubs it, the genie appears.
"You have one wish."

John proudly says:
"I want a mountain of gold!"

"Your wish is granted," says the genie.

John runs outside and sees… a giant mountain of mould.

Furious, he goes back to the neighbour:
"Your genie isn't just deaf — he's stupid! I asked for a mountain of gold, and he gave me a mountain of mould!"

The neighbour nods and says:
"And do you think *I* asked for world-class tennis?"`
