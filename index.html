  // Long Polish joke rewritten in English storytelling style:
  `John Smith is walking past his neighbour’s house one afternoon when he notices something unbelievable.
Right there on the neighbour’s lawn is a full tennis court. And playing on it are Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal.

Stunned, John asks:
"Mate, why do you have a tennis court and two of the greatest players alive in your garden?"

The neighbour replies:
"I found Aladdin’s lamp. Rubbed it, genie came out, I made a wish — and here we are."

John is thrilled. "Can I try?"
"Of course," says the neighbour, "but the genie is a bit hard of hearing."

John takes the lamp home, rubs it, the genie appears.
"You have one wish."

John proudly says:
"I want a mountain of gold!"

"Your wish is granted," says the genie.

John runs outside and sees… a giant mountain of mould.

Furious, he goes back to the neighbour:
"Your genie isn't just deaf — he's stupid! I asked for a mountain of gold, and he gave me a mountain of mould!"

The neighbour nods and says:
"And do you think I asked for world-class tennis?"`,

  // Long storytelling Trabant joke
  `An Arabic sheikh absolutely loves cars. He owns everything — every Ferrari, every Mercedes, every exotic brand you can imagine.

One day, he wants to buy a car he has never owned before. He looks in a catalogue and suddenly sees something surprising: the Trabant — the pride of East Germany.

Fascinated, he calls the Trabant factory.

"Hello, I am Sheikh Ahmed. I want to buy your car, the Trabant."

The worker on the phone thinks it's a prank and says:
"Sure… it costs 200,000 dollars, and the waiting time is ten years."

The sheikh thanks him and hangs up.

The worker goes to his boss:
"Someone pretended to be Sheikh Ahmed, so I told him a ridiculous price and delivery time."

The boss turns white.
"You fool! That WAS Sheikh Ahmed — the richest man in the world! Send him the Trabant for free RIGHT NOW!"

So they do.

A few weeks later, the sheikh hosts a gathering of wealthy friends who are bragging about their newest cars.

One says:
"I bought a Ferrari. I will wait five years. It cost me $100,000."

Another says:
"That's nothing. I bought a Lamborghini. I will wait seven years. It cost me $150,000."

And the sheikh proudly replies:
"Gentlemen, you are amateurs. I bought a Trabant, the pride of East Germany. It will cost me $200,000, I will wait ten years… and they have already sent me the plastic model!"`
