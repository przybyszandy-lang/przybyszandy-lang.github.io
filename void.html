      <h2>About the Alliance</h2>
      <p>
        Outlaws &amp; Bandits is an alliance for players who make their own luck.
        We don’t play by anyone else’s rules &mdash; we attack anyone, anywhere,
        any time, as long as there is a good reason to strike. Strength, courage
        and initiative are what matter here.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are a <span class="highlight">WarriorAlliance class</span> alliance.
        Every member benefits from WarriorAlliance-class bonuses and plays with a
        clear purpose: grow stronger, strike smart and never apologise for winning.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Membership Requirements</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You must be within the <span class="highlight">Top 300</span> players in the universe to join.</li>
        <li>
          Exception: if you are marked as an <span class="highlight">Outlaw</span> and
          have attacked someone stronger than you, you are also eligible.
        </li>
        <li>We value bold moves and intelligent aggression above everything else.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Ranks Within the Alliance</h2>
      <p>We use military-style ranks for structure and coordination:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="highlight">General</span> &mdash; senior strategic command.</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Colonel</span> &mdash; leads major operations and coordinates squads.</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Major</span> &mdash; supports Colonels in planning and execution.</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Lieutenant</span> &mdash; frontline coordination and scouting.</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Sergeant</span> &mdash; experienced fighters and unit leaders.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Ranks exist to organise attacks and defence, not to control the fate of the alliance.
        <span class="highlight">No rank has the power to delete, disband or remove the alliance.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        The <span class="highlight">Alliance Founder</span> (me) is the only person who can
        remove or fully control the alliance at structural level. All strategic changes,
        including deletion or reformation of the alliance, are under my sole authority.
      </p>

      <h2>Rules of Communication</h2>
      <p>
        We may be Outlaws &amp; Bandits, but we are not chaotic. Our communication rules
        are simple and effective:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <span class="highlight">Target Spotting:</span> we actively help each other
          find good targets. If you see a possible victim with weak defences or bad
          fleet timing, share the intel.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="highlight">Resource Sharing:</span> if you find resources that
          you cannot take yourself, or a target that would be wasted on you, pass it
          on to another member. No profitable planet should be missed if one of us
          can reach it.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="highlight">Recycling Opportunities:</span> if someone in the alliance
          makes a big hit and cannot recycle everything, others should step in to help
          recycle and share reports where appropriate.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="highlight">Politeness:</span> we are polite to everyone &mdash;
          allies, neutrals and even enemies. You do not need insults or negative language
          to destroy planets. Our strength speaks for itself.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="highlight">No Internal Drama:</span> disagreements are handled in
          private chats, calmly and directly. We don’t waste time on drama when we could
          be farming resources instead.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
      <p>
        We attack when we have a reason. We hit hard, we hit smart, and we stand by
        our members. If you like to live on the edge, strike above your weight, and
        respect strength more than titles, Outlaws &amp; Bandits is your home.
