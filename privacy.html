<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>
This website is a personal, non-profit project created for entertainment purposes.
We collect only the minimum amount of information necessary to operate the joke
submission feature.
</p>

<h2>Jokes</h2>

Any joke you submit will be stored permanently.  
This is required for the website to function and for jokes to be displayed to other users.
</p>

<h2>Email Addresses</h2>
<p>
Providing an email address is optional.  
You do not need to give your email address, and it is recommended that you do not.
</p>
<p>
If you choose to provide it, your email will be stored for up to one year and may be used
only if you ever wish to be involved in future development of the project or to be
recognised for your contribution.
</p>
<p>
Your email address will never be sold, shared, transferred, or used for marketing.
</p>

<h2>Data Use</h2>

All stored data remains private within this project.  
No profiling, tracking, analytics, or third-party advertising is used.

If you have any questions or want to request deletion of your email address,
you may contact:

This mailbox may be created in the future, but you can still use it for any
privacy-related enquiries.
